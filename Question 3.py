'''
Increment Value of Key in Dict with Max Limit
Write a function increment_value_with_max_limit that increments the value for a specified key in a dictionary by a given increment value(inc). However, the value should not exceed a specified maximum limit (limit).

Assume the dictionary values are integers. If the resulting value after incrementing is greater than the limit, it should be capped at the limit.

NOTE: This is a function type question, you don't have to take input or print the output, just have to complete the required function definition.

Example

>>> d = {"x": 5, "y": 3, "z": 5}
>>> key, inc, limit = "y", 5, 5
>>> increment_value_with_max_limit(d, key, inc, limit)
>>> d 
{"x": 5, "y": 5, "z": 5} # 3+5=8 but max limit is 5

>>> increment_value_with_max_limit(d, "z", 5, 11)
>>> d
{"x": 5, "y": 5, "z": 10} # 5+5=10 less than limit

>>> increment_value_with_max_limit(d, "x", 5, 4)
>>> d
{"x": 4, "y": 5, "z": 10} # 4+5=9 less than limit
